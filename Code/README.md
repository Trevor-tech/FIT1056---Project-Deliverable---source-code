The project is called EmpowerU and it aims to help adult users educate themselves on Information Technology[IT]

Description:
EmpowerU is a website which allows adult users to gain knowledge about IT through the courses provided on the website. There are three users which are students, teachers and receptionists. Students will be able to view the available courses and enrol or unerol from them at their discretion. They will be able to view assignments posted by teachers and submit their answers for grading. They will also be able to view their grades for each assignment, their overall average and their completion rating. Teachers are able to upload assignments to each course and grade the submissions made by students as well as give feedback. Receptionists are able to enroll and unenroll students from the website and have an overview of the students progression. They are able to schedule meetings between users and generate reports for documentation purposes.

Operation:
from the main.py file, you run it and a login screen will appear. Based on the login credentials, they will be sent to either the student_page, teacher_page or the receptionist_page. From there, each interface will have different available functions. Students will be able to view courses, download and submit assignments, and view grades. Teachers will be able to create assignments and grade the submissions made by students and view a students overall progress. For receptionist, they are able to manage enrollments, schedule meetings and generate reports for documentation. All these interfaces include a logout button where they will return to the main page.
